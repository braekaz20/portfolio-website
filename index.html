    <h2>Projects</h2>


    <h3>➲ Personal Portfolio Website (Ongoing)</h3>

    <p>I am currently working on my personal portfolio website, which serves as a digital representation of my
        skills, experience, and projects. This website is built using HTML and CSS and will be continuously improved
        as I learn JavaScript and responsive design. The goal is to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate,
        and informative portfolio that highlights my journey in IT support and web development. I have hosted this
        project on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to recruiters, potential collaborators, and fellow developers.
    </p>

    <h3>➲ Basic To-Do List (Upcoming Project)</h3>

    <p>As I progress in my web development journey, I am planning to build a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. This project will help me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive user
        interfaces. The To-Do List will allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with an intuitive
        and responsive design. As I advance, I aim to enhance it with local storage functionality, ensuring tasks
        are saved even after refreshing the page.
    </p>

    <h3>➲ IT Knowledge Base (Future Idea)</h3>

    <p>Having worked as a Service Desk Engineer, I have gained valuable experience in troubleshooting technical
        issues. My goal is to create an IT Knowledge Base—a website containing step-by-step troubleshooting guides,
        FAQs, and solutions for common IT problems. This project will not only help IT professionals but also assist
        non-technical users in solving basic issues independently. I plan to incorporate a search function and
        categorized articles, making it easy for users to find relevant solutions quickly. In the future, I may
        integrate a chatbot to provide instant IT support.
